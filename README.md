# ScalAT
SAT modelling and solving with SCALA and SAT solver (SAT4J).

In *src/main/scala* folder we can find:

* Class **ScalAT** is a wrapper that allows to build a CNF file with basic constraints  encoded to SAT and then ask for solving and retrieving model (if any).
This class has some constraints not fully implemented. Their implementation is left as excercise.

* Several examples are also provided such as **NQueens**, **TestSorter**, etc.

* Object template **CrowdedChessboard** is to be filled as exercise. We recommend to use **NQueens** as initial inspiration.

In *working* folder the auxiliar files are created such as 
* cnf input files
* output files
